### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a French/Hungarian Back-end C/C++ software engineer, working at Mailspec.

The programming languages that I have the most experience with are C, C++, Python, Javascript and Flutter with a focus on C++ and back-end libs like Beast, Asio.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning new technologies, game development and low level programming.
